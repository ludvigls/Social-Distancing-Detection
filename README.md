# Social-Distancing-TEK5030
Built a program where we monitored social distancing using a stereo camera. We used a pre-trained Yolov3 network to detect people and a dense stereo estimator to find their positions in 3D space. Then calculated the shortest distance from a person, to another person. The result was then displayed at the placement of the different people. The picture below show the end result. If you want to see a video, I have attached it in socialdistance.gif.
